# Semi-Supervised Training
Next, I moved on to semi-supervised training. The idea is that since I have a large collection of unlabelled datasets, that it could be possible to train a better model by using the unlabelled dataset in a semi-supervised fashion. Since semi-supervised training is a area of active research right now, this portion is more of a exercise in discovery. I explored several different SSL techniques. Before I start, I 

## Pseduo Labelling 
Using this [Source](https://datawhatnow.com/pseudo-labeling-semi-supervised-learning/), where we label unlabelled data to have pseduo-labeled data, and then we reuse both labelled and pseudo-labelled data to retrain a new model.
